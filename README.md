## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial when:-
The requirements are uncertain where ita allows adjustments to the changing requirements.
there is frequent involvement of stakeholders.
the project demands incremental value delivery.

waterfall is more beneficial when:-
The requirements are clear and well defined.
the documentation and compliance are critical.
the project is a simple project that requires clear timelines and budget for the whole project.

example: A phamarceutical company rolling out an EPR system would use waterfall methodology to meet compliance requirements and avoid mid-project scope changes.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Early and continuous testing- conducting requirement/design review and code inspections to catch defects early.
Automated Testing- use of automated tools for regression, perfomance and security testing to improve efficiency.
Structured Q&A Roles- assigning dedicated roles like test analysts, test designers and test executors.
Configuration management- Tracking code versions and changes to maintain consistency and traceability.
